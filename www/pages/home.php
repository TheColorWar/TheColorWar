                    <p>The Color War provides students of Virginia Tech an opportunity to come together and celebrate unity through diversity. This is the first year that SIA, SHH and ISA have come together to host this event. Together, we aim to unify the different communities at Virginia Tech for one enormous colorful celebration. But what exactly are we celebrating, you ask? We are celebrating the communion of our individualities, or our colors, and all that we can accomplish from coming together. Come celebrate, come with friends, and leave with new ones!</p>
