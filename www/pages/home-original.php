                    <p>The Color War provides students of Virginia Tech an opportunity to come together and celebrate unity through diversity. This is the first year that SIA, SHH and ISA have come together to host this event. Together, we aim to unify the different communities at Virginia Tech for one enormous colorful celebration. But what exactly are we celebrating, you ask? We are celebrating the communion of our individualities, or our colors, and all that we can accomplish from coming together. Come celebrate, come with friends, and leave with new ones!</p>

                    <p>To get started, we invite you to head on over to the “About” page for more detailed information about what to wear and bring and the date, time and location of the event! In addition it you can read about the cause of the event and who this benefits! You can also find additional information on the “FAQ” page where we have answers to your most popular questions.</p>

                    <p>Once you feel well-versed with the important information on the “About” page, the next step is clicking on the “Registration” link. There is where you’re able to select how much color you want, if you want a ridiculously awesome The Color War T-Shirt, and take advantage of our deals while they last! </p>
